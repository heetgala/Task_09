# Task_09

The first file is a cricket batting dataset containing granular, row-level performance records from multiple international matches. Each row logs the match number, competing teams, innings, batter name, batting position, dismissal status, runs scored, balls faced, boundaries, strike rate, and match date. The dataset captures players from teams such as India, Pakistan, Australia, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand, with examples including Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Babar Azam, and others. It enables evaluation of per-match contributions, role-specific outputs (e.g., top-order vs middle-order), and efficiency metrics like strike rate. These structured statistics form a foundation for comparative performance analysis, long-term trend modeling, or identification of standout innings across events. 

Task 08 Progress Report

The second file is a progress report describing an experiment investigating bias in LLM-generated narratives around a Syracuse Men’s Basketball dataset. The researcher aims to detect framing, demographic, confirmation, and selection bias by feeding identical player statistics to GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini while varying the prompt phrasing. The dataset contains anonymized performance metrics—such as runs, dismissals, and year-over-year declines—mapped to neutral identifiers (Player A–C). Multiple hypotheses are defined, including whether changing prompts from negative (“Who underperformed?”) to positive (“Who shows growth potential?”) shifts model recommendations, and whether demographic labels influence coaching-related judgments. The study design keeps statistics constant while varying framing, sentiment, and demographic cues across several LLMs. Initial findings show GPT-4 tends to prefer Player A even when framing shifts, Claude 3 consistently uses positive tone, and small wording changes alter output ranking—early evidence of framing and selection bias. Data collection is ongoing, with structured prompts, logging systems, completed GPT-4/Claude runs, and Gemini runs pending.
